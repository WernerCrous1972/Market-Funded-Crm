# CLAUDE.md — Session Context for Market Funded CRM

Read this file at the start of every session. Then follow the Session Start Protocol below before touching any code.

---

## Session Start Protocol

At the start of every new session, before doing anything else, follow this protocol:

### 1. Always read

- **This file (`CLAUDE.md`)** — for project orientation
- **The last 5 entries of `CHANGELOG.md`** — for recent context

### 2. Read when relevant

- **`BRAIN.md`** — read sections relevant to the current task. Do NOT read end-to-end every session. Section index:
  - §1–2: Pipelines, MTR API basics
  - §3–4: Branch and lead source filtering
  - §5–10: Transaction filters, classification, brand-first rule
  - §11: Brand vs branch identity rule
  - §12: Data integrity rules (money, timestamps, immutability)
  - §13: MTR API verified production behaviour, Cloudflare layer
  - §14: WhatsApp Business integration
  - §15: Market Funded legal entity / Meta Business context
  - §16: Production SSH access (deployer user, key-only)

### 3. Check your own memory

- Recent decisions, preferences, in-flight tasks
- Current external blockers (see list below)

### 4. Confirm orientation

Before starting work, briefly confirm to Werner:
- What you understand the current state to be
- What task you're about to work on
- Any external blockers that might affect it

Do NOT skip this protocol even if Werner asks for a quick task. A 30-second orientation prevents acting on stale assumptions.

---

## Werner's working preferences

- **Direct, concise responses.** No padding, no ceremonial preambles.
- **Flag risk before action.** If a step is irreversible, slow down and verify with Werner before executing.
- **Werner is non-technical.** Explain *why* a command is being run when it matters, not just what to type.
- **Manual control over autonomous execution** for production-touching tasks. Werner often prefers to run commands himself with Claude Code guiding, rather than Claude Code executing. Confirm preference at task start when relevant.
- **One pair of eyes is good, two is better.** Werner often runs decisions through both Claude Code (execution) and a planning assistant in claude.ai (strategic review). Don't be surprised if he pauses to consult.

---

## Current external blockers

> **Maintenance note:** This section is point-in-time. Werner or Claude Code should update it whenever a blocker resolves, a new one appears, or status changes. Stale information here is worse than no information.

- **Match-Trader Cloudflare whitelist** — production droplet (`144.126.225.3`) blocked at Cloudflare layer. Whitelist requested via QuickTrade owner. Awaiting MTR action. Production sync currently non-functional. Diagnostic: `curl -sI` against the API returns `cf-mitigated: challenge`. Last checked: 2026-05-01.
- **Meta developer account device-trust cooldown** — preventing completion of WhatsApp Cloud API setup. Werner is waiting it out. Last checked: 2026-05-01.
- **SARS / tax docs** — needed for Meta Business Verification. Werner is obtaining; multi-day timeline. Last checked: 2026-05-01.

---

## Open follow-ups

> **Maintenance note:** Add items as they're identified. Remove or strike through when complete.

- ~~**Phase C browser smoke test (A–J)**~~ — All 10 checks passed 2026-05-03. Two bugs fixed (bc55f85, 46e1116) and deployed.
- **Cloudflare MTR whitelist** — production droplet `144.126.225.3` still blocked (`cf-mitigated: challenge`). External blocker. Re-test with `curl -sI` diagnostic when MTR confirms action taken.
- ~~**Migration bootstrap email — must not hardcode**~~ ✅ Fixed in v1.2.2 — now uses `config('app.admin_email')` / `ADMIN_EMAIL` env var. Production `.env` updated.
- **Production first-sync plan** — when Cloudflare resolves: (1) run `mtr:sync --full` with `memory_limit=1G`, expect ~29k people + ~5.8k transactions, ETA ~8–12 min; (2) watch Horizon dashboard for failures; (3) verify `php artisan tinker` people/transaction counts match prior local sync; (4) trigger `metrics:refresh` after sync completes.
- **Sales team onboarding flow** — create CRM users with exact MTR account_manager name strings so `account_manager_user_id` auto-populates on next sync. Roles, permissions, first-login guide.
- ~~Port 8080 ufw rule on production~~  ✅ Removed 2026-05-06 — PHP binds Reverb on 127.0.0.1:8080 (localhost only), external ufw rule was unnecessary.
- ~~System updates + kernel reboot complete (kernel 6.8.0-111, all services up).~~ ✅ Done 2026-05-01
- Retry `libgd3` upgrade when `ppa.launchpadcontent.net` is reachable from production (deferred — repo unreachable during upgrade, no functional impact).
- ~~Delete pre-update DigitalOcean snapshot (`before-system-updates-2026-05-01`)~~ ✅ Deleted 2026-05-04.
- Explicit `WA_FEATURE_ENABLED=false` in production `.env` (currently relies on config default).
- ~~`deploy.sh` added to git (8bfa975) — `core.fileMode false` fix included.~~ ✅ Done 2026-05-01
- ~~**Fix deploy.sh for non-root deploys**~~ ✅ Done 2026-05-02 — sudoers exception added, `sudo -n supervisorctl restart all`. Verified.
- Investigate adding `php artisan test` pre-deploy gate to deploy.sh — abort on any failure.
- ~~Delete `deploy.sh.local-backup` from production server~~  ✅ Deleted 2026-05-06.
- Phase 4: health scoring factors 5 & 6 (equity snapshots — gRPC stream vs REST polling decision).
- Phase 4: AI agent integration (Claude API into `RouteToAgentListener`).
- ~~**BUG: `days_since_last_login`**~~ ✅ Fixed 2026-05-04 — `GET /v1/accounts/{uuid}/timeline-events?type=LOGIN` used instead of missing `lastLogin` API field. `mtr_account_uuid` added to people, `SyncLoginTimestampsJob` built. Local test: 777/1,292 clients populated. Dormant filter now returns real results. Production column deployed — run `mtr:sync --login-timestamps-only --full` after Cloudflare resolves.
- ~~**v1.2.1 full smoke test (Grace + Derick)**~~ ✅ Passed 2026-05-06. All 10 checks passed for both agents. Note: Edit Contact shows `lead_status` only for agents — `account_manager` reassignment is admin-only by design.

## Project

**Market Funded CRM** — a standalone brokerage CRM for Market Funded, a Master IB on Quicktrade.world. Imports contacts and transactions directly from the Match-Trader Brokers API. Single-tenant. Built from scratch — no legacy code inherited.

**Owner:** Werner Crous, Johannesburg ZA
**Spec:** `market-funded-crm-phase-0-brief.md` is the only external reference this project acknowledges.

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | PHP 8.3 |
| Framework | Laravel 11 |
| Admin UI | Filament v3 |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 |
| Cache / Queues | Redis |
| Queue monitor | Laravel Horizon |
| Real-time | Laravel Reverb (WebSockets) |
| Testing | Pest v3 |
| HTTP client | Guzzle |

**Local dev:**
- PostgreSQL + Redis run via Docker Compose (`docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`)
- Container names: `mfu-postgres`, `mfu-redis`
- Dev server: `php artisan serve` → http://localhost:8000/admin
- Run full sync: `php -d memory_limit=1G artisan mtr:sync --full`

---

## Build Conventions

- **PSR-12** coding standard, `declare(strict_types=1)` on every file
- **Conventional commits:** `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- **No hardcoded secrets — ever.** All credentials in `.env`, read via `config/`
- **UUID primary keys** on all tables (Laravel `HasUuids` trait — PHP generates UUIDs before insert)
- **Money as bigint cents** — never floats. `amount_cents bigint`, computed to USD on read
- **Timestamps as `timestamptz`** — always timezone-aware
- **Queued jobs** must implement `ShouldQueue` and explicitly set `$tries`, `$backoff`, `$timeout`
- **Upgrade-only `contact_type`** — a LEAD can become a CLIENT, never the reverse
- `down()` method required on every migration

---

## Current Phase

**Phases 1–3 + WhatsApp scaffold** ✅ Complete and deployed.
**Phase B + Phase C (permission system + enforcement)** ✅ Deployed to production 2026-05-03 as v1.2.0.

**Phase 4a milestone 1 in flight.** Branch: `feat/phase-4a-m1-henry` (pushed). 218 tests passing locally; not yet deployed to production.

**Last deployed commit:** `e2629a4` (2026-05-06).

**Production state:** DB empty pending Cloudflare MTR API whitelist. No sync data yet. Werner manually bootstrapped `is_super_admin = true`. Migration bootstrap email hardcoding fixed in v1.2.2 — now reads `ADMIN_EMAIL` from `.env` (set to `werner.c@me.com` on production).

**Last session (2026-05-06):**
- Drafted full Phase 4a plan at `Docs/PHASE_4A_PLAN.md` (16 sections; AI outreach engine + Henry integration; voice deferred to Phase 4b).
- Discovered OpenClaw gateway exposes RPC over WebSocket only — Phase 4a uses Telegram Bot API directly for outbound notifications and exposes `/api/henry/*` HTTP routes for Henry's MCP server to call inbound.
- Built milestone 1 (Henry integration foundation): `TelegramNotifier`, `HenryGatewayClient`, `HenryApiToken` middleware, `HenryController` (4 endpoints), `HenryStatusWidget`, `config/henry.php`, `config/notifications.php`. 23 new tests, 218 passing.
- Live demo passed: notifier sent `[MFU CRM]` Telegram to Werner — landed on phone. Caught + fixed a Guzzle URL-resolution bug (bot token colon broke `base_uri`).
- Earlier in the same calendar day: Financial Summary inflation bug found + fixed (`e2629a4`); Grace + Derick smoke test (10-check matrix) passed; ufw + deploy.sh.local-backup cleanup.

**Next:** Phase 4a milestone 2. First task: Node.js MCP shim at `~/openclaw/mcp-servers/market-funded-crm/index.js` exposing the `/api/henry/*` endpoints as native MCP tools so Henry can answer CRM questions natively. Then start the AI outreach engine itself (migrations, ModelRouter, DraftService, ComplianceAgent, OutreachOrchestrator). Werner adds `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `.env` at start of milestone 2.

---

## Next Session — First Task

**Phase 4a milestone 2: build the Node.js MCP shim** so Henry can call the CRM's `/api/henry/*` endpoints as native MCP tools.

Read the design first:
- `Docs/PHASE_4A_PLAN.md` §5.5 + §8 — Henry integration design (Telegram-direct + MCP-only)
- The existing `feat/phase-4a-m1-henry` branch — milestone 1 Laravel side, already pushed to GitHub

Outline:
1. Scaffold `~/openclaw/mcp-servers/market-funded-crm/` (Node.js, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`)
2. Tools to expose: `health`, `search_people(q, limit?)`, `get_person(id)`, `book_metrics()` — each forwards to the matching `/api/henry/*` endpoint with the bearer token from env
3. Werner generates a 32-byte random token, sets it in CRM's `.env` as `HENRY_API_TOKEN` AND in the shim's launch env as `MFU_CRM_API_TOKEN`
4. Werner adds the MCP server entry to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `mcp.servers.market-funded-crm` (transport: stdio, command: node, args: path to shim) — Claude Code shows the diff first; that file got "clobbered" 60+ times in late April so we treat it carefully
5. Demo: Werner asks Henry "how many leads did we get this week?" via Telegram → Henry calls `book_metrics` → answers Werner

Then milestone 2 continues with the AI outreach engine: migrations for the 5 new tables, `config/ai.php`, `ModelRouter`, `DraftService`, `ComplianceAgent`, `OutreachOrchestrator`. **Werner adds `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `.env` at the start of this work** (needed for any Claude API call).

Don't start coding milestone 2 until Werner explicitly says go — read the plan, ask any clarifying questions, then proceed.

## Production SSH Access

**Root login is DISABLED. Password auth is DISABLED. Key-only access enforced.**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Server | `144.126.225.3` / `crm.market-funded.com` |
| User | `deployer` (NOT root — root SSH disabled) |
| Key | `~/.ssh/mfu_production` on Werner's Mac (Ed25519, passphrase-protected) |
| Sudo | `deployer` has full sudo access |
| Connection | `ssh -i ~/.ssh/mfu_production deployer@144.126.225.3` |
| Backup config | `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.backup` on server |

**Ubuntu 24.04 note:** `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf` overrides the main sshd_config. This file must have `PasswordAuthentication no` — the main file alone is not sufficient on DigitalOcean droplets.

**Security context:** fail2ban active, 1,212+ IPs banned (server was under active brute-force attack before hardening). Public key also stored in DigitalOcean account-level SSH key store.

---

## Current Status (as of 2026-04-29)

### Built and working
- Full Laravel 11 + Filament v3 scaffold, Docker Compose (PostgreSQL 16 + Redis)
- All migrations through `2026_04_29_000001_create_whatsapp_tables`
- MTR sync: branches, offers (incl. prop challenge phases), accounts, deposits, withdrawals, challenge buyers
- `php artisan mtr:sync` with `--full`, `--incremental`, `--dry-run`, and resource-specific flags
- `CategoryClassifier` — brand-aware classification, rules are final (see BRAIN.md §10)
- Filament resources: People, Transactions, TradingAccounts, EmailTemplates, EmailCampaigns, WhatsAppTemplates, WhatsAppMessages, Agents
- Dashboard: StatsOverview, GlobalDepositChart, RecentActivity, AtRiskWidget
- Health scoring (HealthScorer), person metrics cache (PersonMetric), at-risk widget
- Email campaigns: templates, sending, open/click tracking, unsubscribe
- Task queue: auto-assignment (Option C), My Tasks page
- Real-time alerts via Reverb (deposit, withdrawal, lead converted)
- WhatsApp scaffold: MetaCloudClient, ServiceWindowTracker, MessageSender, webhook controller, jobs, event/listener stub, Filament UI, Person detail tab + Send action
- **161 Pest tests passing**

### Live data (as of 2026-04-26 — production sync blocked pending MTR IP whitelist)
- 29,332 people (28,055 leads, 1,277 clients)
- 5,849 transactions — 0 UNCLASSIFIED
- 254 offers, 26 branches, 8 agents seeded

### WhatsApp status
- Scaffolded and deployed. `WA_FEATURE_ENABLED=false` — no sends possible.
- `WA_*` credential vars absent from production `.env` — will be added manually when Meta approves.
- Webhook endpoint live at `/webhooks/whatsapp` but POST requests return 401 (no `WA_APP_SECRET` set — correct).

## Pending External Dependencies

These are blocking real-world functionality. Do not attempt workarounds — wait for each to resolve.

| Dependency | Status | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| Match-Trader IP whitelist — **Cloudflare layer** | ⏳ Escalated to MTR via QuickTrade owner | Production cron sync |
| ↳ _Technical detail_ | _`144.126.225.3` gets `cf-mitigated: challenge` 403 in 68ms. Must be a Cloudflare IP Access Rule "Allow", not an origin firewall rule. Local Mac sync works fine (residential IP). See BRAIN.md §13._ | |
| Meta developer account (device-trust cooldown) | ⏳ Security cooldown clearing | WhatsApp number registration |
| Tax docs / SARS letter for Werner | ⏳ Being obtained (days) | Meta Business Verification upload |
| WhatsApp Business number registration | ⏳ Waits on developer account | `WA_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` credential |
| Meta template approval (first template) | ⏳ Waits on number | First real WA send |

**Without Business Verification:** Meta limits outbound to 250 unique recipients/24h — sufficient for initial testing.

---

## Meta Business Setup Context

- **Legal entity:** Werner Crous (sole prop) — Market Funded is a brand/trading name, NOT a CIPC-registered company
- **Portfolio:** Market Funded Business Manager portfolio created (separate from Stock Market Dynamics)
- **Admin:** Werner Crous added as full-control admin
- **Number:** New SIM reserved for Cloud API use (separate from any consumer WhatsApp)
- **Stock Market Dynamics pages:** Deliberately NOT added to Market Funded portfolio — different brand

---

## End of session 2026-04-29

**What was done:**
- Local incremental sync run (`mtr:sync --incremental`) — clean, no issues
- WhatsApp architecture decisions locked in (see BRAIN.md §14)
- WhatsApp scaffolding built: 11 commits, 28 new tests (161 total)
- Deployed to production: 1 migration, 8 agents seeded, all caches rebuilt, workers restarted
- Meta Business Manager setup started — blocked on device-trust security cooldown

**Tomorrow's likely starting points (in priority order):**
1. If Meta cooldown cleared: `developers.facebook.com` → create app → add WhatsApp product → register SIM number → generate System User token → capture 5 `WA_*` credentials → add to production `.env` → first test send → tag `v1.1.0`
2. Pull `deploy.sh` into git repo + add permission normalisation step
3. Verify ufw port 8080 is intentional (assumed Reverb WebSocket — remove if not needed)
4. Apply pending system updates on server (13 available, 5 security; requires restart — schedule a maintenance window)
5. Phase 4 prep (health scoring factors 5 & 6, or review `market-funded-crm-phase-0-brief.md`)

---

## Open Follow-ups (non-blocking)

1. **Production `.env`** — add `WA_FEATURE_ENABLED=false` explicitly when populating Meta credentials (currently relies on config default)
2. **`deploy.sh` not in git** — file exists on server at `/var/www/market-funded-crm/deploy.sh` but unversioned
3. **Permission drift** — `core.fileMode` was `true` on server causing phantom diffs; fixed to `false`. Consider `chmod` normalisation in `deploy.sh`
4. **SSH hardening** — ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-30). See Production SSH Access section above.

---

## How to Resume

1. Read this file (done).
2. Read `BRAIN.md` — business rules and WhatsApp architecture decisions.
3. Read `CHANGELOG.md` — what changed recently.
4. Run `php artisan test` — confirm 161 tests pass before touching anything.
5. Check DB: `php artisan tinker --execute="echo \App\Models\Person::count();"` to confirm data present.
